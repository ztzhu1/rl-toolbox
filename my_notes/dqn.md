- `tanh` performs well in PG, but may be unsuitable for DQN.

- **Q**: Why do we use the epsilon-greedy policy instead of a random policy?

  **A (ChatGPT)**: The reason why we use an epsilon-greedy policy instead of just using a random policy is that a purely random policy could lead to the agent taking suboptimal actions most of the time, and may take an unreasonable amount of time to converge to an optimal policy. On the other hand, a purely greedy policy could lead to the agent getting stuck in local optima and may miss out on discovering the optimal path.

- **Q**: Why does large batch size lead to poor performance?

  **A (ChatGPT)**: While larger batch sizes can lead to faster convergence during training and can sometimes improve model performance, there are cases where using a large batch size can lead to worse results in DQN.

  One reason for this is that larger batch sizes can generate more correlated gradients, resulting in less diverse updates that may not generalize well to different states. This can lead to the DQN model getting stuck in non-optimal policies, making it harder for the agent to explore other potential actions in the environment.

  Additionally, when using a large batch size in DQN, we may suffer from a phenomenon called "overfitting to the replay buffer." Essentially, using a large batch size means the model is learning from the same set of experiences repeatedly, leading to over-learning of certain states and actions. This can result in the agent becoming overly confident in its current set of actions and not attempting new behaviors when exploring the environment.

  In summary, using a larger batch size may not be optimal in DQN due to increased correlation between gradients, overfitting to the replay buffer, and less diverse updates. It's important to experiment with different batch sizes to find the optimal one for the specific environment and neural network architecture.

- **Q**: Should we always use huber loss?

  **A (ChatGPT)**: The choice of loss function in Deep Q-Learning (DQL) algorithm depends on the problem's specific characteristics and the desired behavior of the algorithm. While the mean squared error (MSE) loss function is the most commonly used loss function in DQL, Huber loss function can be a good alternative.

  Huber loss function is a combination of squared and absolute loss functions and is less sensitive to outliers than the MSE loss function. This property of Huber loss function can make DQL algorithms more robust to noisy data and can lead to faster convergence. However, Huber loss function has additional hyperparameters that need to be tuned.

  It is not always necessary to use Huber loss function in DQL. In some cases, the MSE loss function can work well, especially when the data is relatively clean, the action values do not vary significantly, and the network is not too deep. For example, if the agent's actions are discrete, the MSE loss function may work better.

  In summary, the choice of loss function in DQL depends on the specific problem at hand. While Huber loss function can be a good alternative to MSE loss function, it may not always be necessary to use it. It is advisable to experiment with different loss functions and choose the one that works best for the specific problem.
